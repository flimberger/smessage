smessage - simple message viewer
================================
smessage is a simple message display utility for the X window system, which is
intended to replace xmessage with a more modern and visually appealing
counterpart.

Requirements
------------
In order to build smessage you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (smessage is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install smessage (if
necessary as root):

	make clean install

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of smessage is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code.
